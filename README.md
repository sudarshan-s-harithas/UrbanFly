# UrbanFly: Uncertainty-Aware Planning for Navigation Amongst High-Rises with Monocular Visual-Inertial SLAM Maps

UrbanFly: an uncertainty-aware realtime planning framework for quadrotor navigation in urban high-rise environments. A core aspect of UrbanFly is its ability to robustly plan directly on the sparse point clouds generated by a Monocular Visual Inertial SLAM (VINS) backend. Through UrbanFly we present two trajectory optimizers, The first optimizer uses gradient-free cross-entropy method to compute trajectories that minimize collision probability and smoothness cost. Our second optimizer is a simplified version of the first and uses a sequential convex programming optimizer initialized based on probabilistic safety estimates on a set of randomly drawn trajectories.Empowered by the algorithmic innovation, UrbanFly outperforms competing baselines in metrics such as collision rate, trajectory length, etc., on a high fidelity AirSim simulator augmented with synthetic and real-world dataset scenes

### **Note: This code repository is under developent** 


## Setup:

The planner evaluations were done on an 8-Core Intel Core i7-10870H processor, with 16GB RAM and 500GB HDD, running Ubunut 18.04 and ros melodic. we do recommend using powerfull setup.

A simulation server was setup that hosted the simulation environments within the Unreal Engine.
